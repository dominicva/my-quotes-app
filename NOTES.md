- http.createServer doing three main things for us,
- 2 in node, 1 in JS.
-
- In Node:
- 1.  Command for node internals to set up the network
- feature of node specialising in http. With the help of
- libuv, node sets up open socket/channel to internet in
- the computer's networking internals. The computer is now ready
- to receive messages on the specified channel
- (the port).
-
- 2.  Stores function passed as argument (doOnIncoming)
- to createServer to be autorun when we get an incoming message.
-
- In JS:
- 3.  Immediately returns an object full of methods,
- including listen and on, which when run allow us to edit
- the instance of the http node feature we've set up.
-
- When we receive incoming request, node executes that function,
- which will eventually send a response message back.
- Node automatically packages up two (names/labels decided by
- us, 'req' and 'res' are just convention) JS objects for us.
-
- 1: import info from inbound message:
- {
-     url {string},
-     and lots of other things...
- }
- Has data on it that we can grab directly.
-
- 2.  Has a bunch of method labels/bindings (including end).
- Whatever we pass to end will be used to add data to the
- response message. This obj has functions that when run
- from JS will be labels (back into node) to update the
- data on the message that gets sent back.
